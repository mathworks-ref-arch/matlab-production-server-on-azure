[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmathworks-ref-arch%2Fmatlab-production-server-on-azure%2Fmaster%2Freleases%2FR2024b%2Ftemplates%2Fazuredeploy24b.json)

> MATLAB Release: R2024b

<p>Creating resources on Azure can take at least 30 minutes.</p>

## Step 2. Configure Cloud Resources
Provide values for parameters in the custom deployment template on the Azure Portal :

| Parameter Name | Value |
|--------------- | ----- |
| **Subscription**            | Choose an Azure subscription to use for purchasing resources.<p><em>Example:</em> VERTHAM Dev</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Resource group**          | Choose a name for the resource group that will hold the resources. It is recommended you create a new resource group for each deployment. This allows all resources in a group to be deleted simultaneously. <p><em>Example:</em> Saveros</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Region**                | Choose the region to start resources in. Select a region which supports your requested instance types. To check which services are supported in each location, see [Azure Region Services](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/regions/services/>). MathWorks recommends using East US or East US 2. <p><em>Example:</em> East US</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Location**                | Specify the location where the MATLAB Production Server instance will be deployed or use the default value. |
| **Server VM Instance Size** | Specify the size of the VM you plan on using for deployment. Each MATLAB Production Server instance runs on a VM and each instance runs multiple workers. We recommend you choose a VM size where the number of cores on your VM matches the number of MATLAB workers per VM you plan on using. The template defaults to Standard_D4s_v3. This configuration has 4 vCPUs and 16 GiB of memory. For more information, see the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general). <p><em>Example:</em> Standard_D4s_v3</p> |
| **Dashboard VM Size** | Specify the size of the VM you plan on using for the MATLAB Production Server dashboard. The dashboard lets you configure server settings and manage deployed applications. In most cases, choosing the smallest VM size is adequate. The template defaults to Standard_D1_v2. For more information, see the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general). <p><em>Example:</em> Standard_D1_v2</p> |
| **Instance Count**          | Number of VMs to run MATLAB Production Server instances. Each MATLAB Production Server instance runs on a VM and each instance runs multiple workers. <p><em>Example:</em> 6</p><p>If you have a standard 24 worker MATLAB Production Server license and select Standard_D4s_v3 VM (4 cores) as the Server VM Instance Size, you need 6 VMs to fully use the workers in your license. Therefore, your instance count will be 6.</p><p>You can always underprovision the number of VMs, in which case you may end up using fewer workers than you are licensed for.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Admin Username**          | Specify the administrator username for all VMs. Use this username to log in to the MATLAB Production Server dashboard and network license manager. |
| **Admin Password**          | Specify the administrator password for all VMs. Use this password to log in to the MATLAB Production Server dashboard and network license manager. |
| **Allow connections from** | Specify the IP address range that is allowed to connect to the dashboard that manages the server and to the network license manager. The format for this field is IP Address/Mask. <p><em>Example</em>: 10.0.0.1/32</p> <ul><li>This is the public IP address which can be found by searching for "what is my ip address" on the web. The mask determines the number of IP addresses to include.</li><li>A mask of 32 is a single IP address.</li><li>If you need a range of IP addresses, use a [CIDR calculator](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr).</li><li>To determine which address is appropriate, contact your IT administrator.</li></ul></p> |
| **Create Azure Redis Cache**| Choose whether you want to create an Azure Redis Cache service. Creating this service will allow you to use the persistence functionality of the server. Persistence provides a mechanism to cache data between calls to MATLAB code running on a server instance.|
| **Use Public IP Addresses**| Choose 'Yes' if you want to make your solution available over the Internet. <br/>If you choose 'No', the ARM template does not assign a public IP address for the VM that hosts the dashboard. To access the dashboard, you can use a different VM located in the same virtual network as the VM that hosts the dashboard.  |
|**Platform**| Choose the operating system for the server. Microsoft Windows and Linux are the only available options. |                                                            
|**New or Existing Virtual Network**|  Select 'new' to create a new virtual network for your deployment using the default values shown in the parameters after this one. Any changes to these parameter values are ignored. <br/><br/> Select 'existing' to specify an existing virtual network by updating the parameters after this one. <br/><br/> If you are deploying to an existing virtual network, open these ports in your network:<ul><li>`443` &mdash; Required for communicating with the dashboard</li><li>`8000`, `8004`, `8080`, `9090`, `9910` &mdash; Required for communication between the dashboard, MATLAB Production Server workers, and various microservices within the virtual network. These ports do not need to be open to the Internet.</li><li>`27000` &mdash; Required for communication between the network license manager and the workers.</li><li>`65200`&ndash;`65535` &mdash; Required for the Azure application gateway health check to work. These ports need to be accessible over the Internet. For more information, see [MSDN Community](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/96a77f18-3b71-45d2-a213-c4ba63fd4e63/internal-application-gateway-backend-health-is-unkown?forum=WAVirtualMachinesVirtualNetwork).</li><li>`22`, `3389` &mdash; (Optional) Enables Remote Desktop functionality, which can be used for troubleshooting and debugging.</li></ul><p>If you are deploying to a new virtual network, these ports are opened by default.</p><p>You can close ports 22 and 3389 after deployment.</p> |
| **Virtual Network Name** |  Specify the name of your existing virtual network or use the default value.   |
| **Virtual Network CIDR Range** |  Specify the IP address range of the virtual network in CIDR notation or use the default value. |

Click **Create** to begin the deployment. This can take up to 40 minutes.

## Step 3. Upload License File
The Network License Manager for MATLAB manages the MATLAB Production Server license file. The MATLAB Production Server deployment template provides an option to deploy the license manager or use an existing license manager. For more information about the Network License Manager for MATLAB, see [Network License Manager for MATLAB](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/license-manager-for-matlab-on-azure). The following steps show how to upload the license file using the Network License Manager for MATLAB dashboard: 
> **Note**: You must provide a fixed license server MAC address to get a license file from the MathWorks License Center. For more information, see [Configure MATLAB Production Server License for Use on the Cloud](https://www.mathworks.com/help/mps/server/configure-matlab-production-server-license-for-use-on-the-cloud.html).     
1. In the Azure Portal, click **Resource
    groups** and select the resource group containing your cluster resources.
1. Select **Deployments** from the left pane and click **Microsoft.Template**.
1. Click **Outputs**. Copy the parameter value for **networkLicenseManagerURL** and paste it in a browser.
1. Log in using the administrator username and password that you specified in the [Configure Cloud Resources](#step-2-configure-cloud-resources) step of the deployment process.
1. Follow the instructions in the Network License Manager for MATLAB dashboard to upload your MATLAB Production Server license.


## Step 4. Connect and Log In to the Dashboard
The MALAB Production Server dashboard provides a web-based interface to
configure and manage server instances on the cloud. If your solution uses private IP addresses, you can connect to the dashboard from a VM that belongs to the same virtual network as the VM that hosts the dashboard.
>   **Note:** Complete these steps only after your resource group has been successfully created.

> **Note:** The Internet Explorer web browser is not supported for interacting with the dashboard. 

1.  In the Azure Portal, click **Resource
    groups** and select the resource group you created for this deployment from the list.
1.  Select **Deployments** from the left pane and click **Microsoft.Template**.
1.  Click **Outputs** from the left pane. Copy the parameter value for **dashboardURL** and paste it in a browser.  
1.  Log in using the administrator username and password that you specified in the [Configure Cloud Resources](#step-2-configure-cloud-resources) step of the deployment process.

![MATLAB Production Server Dashboard](/releases/R2024b/images/dashboardLogin.png?raw=true) 

You are now ready to use MATLAB Production Server on Azure. 

For more information on how to use the dashboard, see [Manage MATLAB Production Server Using the Dashboard](https://www.mathworks.com/help/mps/server/use-matlab-production-server-cloud-dashboard-on-azure-reference-architecture.html).

Configuring role-based access control for the dashboard is recommended. Role-based access control uses Azure AD to let you grant users the privileges to perform tasks on the dashboard and server, based on their role. For more information on how to configure role-based access control, see [Dashboard Access Control](https://www.mathworks.com/help/mps/server/dashboard-access-control-for-azure-reference-architecture.html).

To run applications on MATLAB Production Server, you will need to create applications using MATLAB Compiler SDK. For more information, see [Create Deployable Archive for MATLAB Production Server](https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/mps_dev_test/create-a-deployable-archive-for-matlab-production-server.html).
